Using transform = scale(); seems to work well to resize pizzas,

EXCEPT that now, when the user zooms the page, the pizzas remain
at their present level.

I wonder if I there is some zoom_level_change event that I can 
catch to fix this.

I see there is 'onresize'.  Can I use that?

ok, changing zoom definitely triggers onresize.
